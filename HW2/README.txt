# INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING #

1. Install Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

2. Open the file 'Homework 2.ipynb' in Jupyter Notebook

3. Uncomment the last line in the first code cell
    (!pip install -r requirements.txt)

    To uncomment, just erase the '#' in the beginning
    of the line

4. Run each cell sequentially by pressing the 'Run' button
    (shortcut is Shift+Enter)

    or alternatively,

    On the navigation bar, open the menu 'Cell' and click
    'Run All'



P.S.: If for some reason it is not possible to run the code 
    directly, please check 'Homework 2.html' by opening it in 
    your browser. It is the same 'Homework 2.ipynb' but as a 
    .html file, with all the code and the respective outputs 
    of the cells. Of course it is not runable, but i promise 
    you it is the absolutely same code with the same outputs 
    that would be generated if 'Homework 2.ipynb' were to be ran.
